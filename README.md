## 🌟 Overview

The Automated Applicant Tracker processes applicants in bulk using:

- A **CSV file** containing applicant details  
- **Role-specific job descriptions**  
- Individual **résumé files**  
- An **AI-powered résumé evaluation engine**

The system automatically:

✔ Evaluates candidates using AI  
✔ Generates match scores (0–100)  
✔ Highlights strengths & skill gaps  
✔ Gives a hiring recommendation  
✔ Updates each candidate’s status  
✔ Produces structured output (CSV + JSON)

This transforms manual applicant tracking into a simple, repeatable, automated workflow.
